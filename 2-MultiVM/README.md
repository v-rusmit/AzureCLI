# Running multiple VMs on Azure for scalability and availability

## Description
This configuration is meant for running multiple instances with the same VM image.  The intended scenario is a single-tier app, such as a stateless web app or storage cluster, using multiple instances for scalability and availability.  Multi-tier applications are not included.

In this architecture, the workload is distributed across the VM instances. There is a single public IP address, and Internet traffic is distributed to the VMs using a load balancer. This architecture can be used for a single-tier app, such as a stateless web app or storage cluster. It is also a building block for N-tier applications.

## Deployment

The template is set up to deploy a 3-tier sample web application to demonstrate the template’s functionality.  Users can deploy infrastructure only, without the sample application, via the “Deploy to Azure” button.  Instructions for deploying via the button, both with and without the sample application, are [included here](./DeployToAzure.md).

### Deploy using the Azure Portal
